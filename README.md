## PPGR_Homework_1
This repo represents my first homework for the elective course at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade, called:
  - Application of Projective Geometry in Computing

I have implemented three algorithms for perspective mappings with a GUI for importing and correcting image distortion:
  - Naive algorithm
  - Direct Linear Transform (DLT) algorithm
  - Normalized DLT algorithm


### Requirements and running
Software: python3  
Libraries: pyqt5, PIL, Pillow

```sh
$  pip install -r requirements.txt
$. python3 main.py
```
