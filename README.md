# PPGR_Homework1
This repo represents my first homework for the elective course at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade, called: 
Application of Projective Geometry in Computing.

I have implemented three algorithms for perspective mappings and made a GUI for importing and correcting image distortion.

Software: python3
Libraries: pyqt5, PIL, Pillow

Before starting the application, you should run: pip install -r requirements.txt 
After that just start the application with: python3 main.py
